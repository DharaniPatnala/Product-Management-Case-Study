In this scenario, the e-commerce business team wants to push flash sales more aggressively to increase short-term revenue. However, users are complaining that the homepage has become too cluttered and they are finding it difficult to locate regular items. My role as a PM is to find a middle ground that respects business objectives while protecting the overall user experience.\n",

When too many promotional banners appear at once, the interface becomes overwhelming. This creates friction for users who simply want to browse normally or quickly buy everyday essentials.\n",
